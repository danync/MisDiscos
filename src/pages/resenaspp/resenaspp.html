          <p>The level of excitement that i felt when ‘favOriTe’ came out was unreal: it was the first time i finally got to watch all my girls together, and being a fan since august 2017  it was a very meaningful moment for me. The song is very cool and lived up to the expectations i had for bbc. they really went for something unique that i've never heard before and i honestly love the production: so many different sounds, synths and rhythms in just one song, the melodies and the instrumental are very high quality. if favorite is 'the iconic signature sound of loona', then we can expect great things  from them.</p>

          <p>After nearly two years Loona is complete, with an auspicious debut that nevertheless leaves much more to be shown.</p>

          <p>I was so excited while listening to the album, I enjoyed it so much. Now I have listened to each song one billion times.</p>
