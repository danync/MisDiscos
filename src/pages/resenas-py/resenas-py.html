        <p>Overall I think it’s a very well produced album. I love the over all theme of it. It’s mostly an upbeat album that’s has a lot of different styles of music within it. Generally I enjoyed this album and am really proud of the boys and what they accomplished. Something I always pride got7 on is how much they improve with each record.They continue to get better and you can see the improvement from their older albums tot his one and I love that about them, it’s great to see improvement in a band that you like and they always impress me with how far they’ve gotten.</p>

        <p>The concept reminds me a lot of the 7 for 7 Present Edition. It makes me wonder if the "Present" in this album is not a coincidence at all. If it's not then, wow mindblown. Concept is solid and something they never did before so... my wig is off.</p>
